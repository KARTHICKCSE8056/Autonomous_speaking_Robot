# AUTONOMOUS SPEAKING ROBOT 

**ABSTRACT**
This project involves creating an intelligent robot capable of answering a wide array of questions from students and the public. Equipped with advanced natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and AI, the robot engages in real-time conversations, interpreting questions to provide accurate responses. It supports both voice and text interaction, making information more accessible. The knowledge base spans general and campus-specific topics, and the system improves over time through machine learning. This innovative tool enhances access to information, offering valuable support for academic inquiries and general knowledge in educational and public settings.

*** Speech to Text ***
Uses Google API to convert spoken questions into text, enabling natural, accessible interactions through real-time speech recognition.

*** Gemini-AI ***
Processes text queries using NLP, retrieves relevant information, and supports multi-turn conversations for a coherent user experience.

*** Text to Speech ***
Utilizes Google API to convert text responses back to speech, delivering clear, human-like answers to enhance user engagement.
